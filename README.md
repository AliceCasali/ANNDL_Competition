# Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning Competition
*Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning* is course offered by Politecnico di Milano for the first time in the acedemic year 2019/2020 (first semester).
In this repository you can find the *Jupyter Notebooks* used by me and a colleague of mine to partecipate at the competition in that academic year (2019/2020).

There was divided into three challenges, each one of them cover a different macroarea of topics of the course:
 - Image Classification 
 - Image Segmentation
 - Visual Question Answering

## 1. Image Classification 
Competition and data available [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ann-and-dl-image-classification)
 - 20 different classes (e.g. airplanes, t-shirt, waterfall, galaxy, ...)
 - 1554 images in training set (with different dimension)
 - 500 for testing
 - **Evaluation**: Multiclass Accuracy

## 2. Image Segmentation
Competition and data available [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ann-and-dl-image-segmentation)
 - Satellite building images, binary segmentation (background/building)
 - 7647 images in training set (size: 256x256)
 - 1234 for testing
 - **Evaluation**: IoU, Insertion over Union

## 3. Visual Question Answering
Competition and data available [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ann-and-dl-vqa)
 - input: an image and a question about the image
 - output: answer to the question. 13 possible answer: numbers from 0 to 10, 'yes' and 'no'
 - 259492 questions in training set (two type of questions: "exists" or "count")
 - 69642 images in training set (320x480)
 - 2754 images for testing
 - 3000 questions for testing
